# EP-Keyword-Categorizer
The `categorizeKeywords()` function is designed for AIESEC's management of exchange participants (EPs) by categorizing their skill sets based on keywords stored in the "oGT Database" spreadsheet. It iterates through each EP's keyword list, splitting and counting occurrences within predefined categories such as IT, Finance, Business Administration, Teaching, Engineering, Marketing, and Other. By comparing counts of keywords in each category, it assigns the most relevant category to each EP and updates the spreadsheet accordingly, providing efficient categorization and organizational clarity essential for AIESEC's operations in handling and deploying EPs effectively based on their skill profiles.
